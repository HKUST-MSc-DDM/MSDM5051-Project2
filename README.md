In this python file, I just realize the simple function: first choose which kind of data we want to search, then choose which way to sort the data, and click the "start" to do the searching. You can get the result you want in the listbox shown on the bottle.<br>
The search function hasn't been written, so the next step is just Mr. Yang job to finish this searching part.
