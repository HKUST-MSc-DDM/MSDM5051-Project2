In this python file, I just realize the simple function: first choose which kind of data we want to search and which way to sort the data, then click the "start" to do the searching. You can get the result you want in the listbox shown on the bottom.<br>
The search function hasn't been written, so the next step is just Mr. Yang job to finish this searching part.
